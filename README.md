# Default-DiscordBot

## Introduction and Purpose
A clonable repository that can be used as a starting point for new discord bot projects. This repo contains my own instructions or "modus operandi", and might not work for you. Follow the instructions under "Getting started" below to get started.


## Getting started
* Start by cloning/forking this repository.
* Remove the "#" from the .gitignore file. (This will prevent changes in your .environ file from being uploaded. That would be VERY bad)
* Go to the discord developer portal. Go to "applications", and create a "New application".
    - Choose a name and provide a short description of your project.
* Grab your bot token, and put it into your .environ file. Formatting should be:

    KEY1 = 12345
